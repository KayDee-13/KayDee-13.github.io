<p>The Australian Sheperd breed originated from Europe, but was bred in California in the 1960s.
    In the past they were working dogs, used for herding livestock on the farms. Eventually, due
    to their medium size they were seen fit to be a common household pet. Loved by most for their 
    loyalty and intelligence.
</p>
<p>I have to say now that I own one, all of these traits are completely accurate. I would describe
    their temperament as calm and collected, but with random bursts of energy. Training for this 
    this breed is relatively easy due to their intelligence. You can even say they can be too smart
    for their own good at times. You have to to keep their minds' stimulated otherwise they tend to 
    get anxious or act out due to boredom. Socially, they are very friendly with other dogs and 
    people too. Australian Sheperds are very protective over children and make great guard dogs.
</p>
<p>I would recommend this beautiful breed to dog owners of every level of experience. Whether it 
    being your first dog or one of many. This breed is perfect for any living situation in my 
    opinion.
